Icelandic--English translator
===================================================================

The is-en system can be used in two ways:

I. Using the standard Apertium pipeline, e.g.:
echo "gamli maðurinn borðaði kalda súpu með mjög góðri lyst" | apertium -d . is-en

II. Use IceNLP in the pipeline (for morphological analysis and PoS tagging)

For the latter, do the following:

1) Get IceNLPCore.zip and IceNLPServer.zip from http://sourceforge.net/projects/icenlp/files/ (only applications, no source)
or
2) check out the source with https://icenlp.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/icenlp. For compiling these sources, refer to the README files found in the core and server subdirectories.
 
Hereafter, we assume that you have selected item 1)
       
3) Unzip IceNLPCore.zip to a directory IceNLPCore. Unzip IceNLPServer.zip to a directory IceNLPServer. 
        
4) Put into your .profile or .bashrc:
        
        export IceNLPCore=/your_path/IceNLPCore
        export IceNLPServer=/your_path/IceNLPServer
        
        These environment variables are needed to make some shell scripts work properly.

5) From the apertum-is-en directory, execute 
./runIceNLPServer.sh
(this runs the daemonised version of IceNLP)
        
6) Thereafter, for testing a translation do: 
echo "gamli maðurinn borðaði kalda súpu með mjög góðri lyst" | ./icenlpApertium.sh
